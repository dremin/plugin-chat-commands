## Disclaimer

**This software is to be considered "sample code", a Type B Deliverable, and is delivered "as-is" to the user. Twilio bears no responsibility to support the use or implementation of this software.**

## Pre-requisites

This plugin is designed for usage with Flex UI 2.x only.

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Next, please install the [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart). If you are using Homebrew on macOS, you can do so by running:

```bash
brew tap twilio/brew && brew install twilio
```

Finally, install the [Flex Plugin extension](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli/install) for the Twilio CLI:

```bash
twilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-flex
```

## Installation

First, clone the repository and change to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twilio-professional-services/plugin-chat-commands.git

cd plugin-emoji-picker
```

Copy `public/appConfig.example.js` to `public/appConfig.js`:

```bash
cp public/appConfig.example.js public/appConfig.js
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the plugin locally:

```bash
twilio flex:plugins:start
```

## Creating Commands

All chat commands are located in the `src/commands` directory. You can create new commands, modify, or remove the existing commands. Modify `src/commands/index.js` to reference the commands you wish to be usable in Flex.

Within a command, the callback function is called when a user selects it. You may modify the message input text, send a message immediately, or do whatever you'd like!

## Development

Run `twilio flex:plugins --help` to see all the commands we currently support. For further details on Flex Plugins refer to our documentation on the [Twilio Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli) page.
